# AngelDocs

Generate beautiful and comprehensive documentation from source.

Supports multiple languages and multi-project repos.

## Motivation

Use this application to share knowledge and document intentions by code authors about specific pieces of code.
Accessible and comprehensive documentation benefits visitors to the code and speeds up the onboarding process.
It is also useful to preserve knowledge as developers come and go.
By keeping the documentation as part of the source itself (internal documentation) as opposed to a separate
library of documents and technical diagrams (external documentation), the documentation grows along with the
code. This keeps it relevant, useful, and available.

This project was inspired by the principles of _Living Documentation_.

## Features

Features summarized:

- Write comments in Markdown
- Output to HTML or Markdown
- Supports multiple languages
- Supports multiple projects
- Write guides in markdown
- Semi-automatic documentation generator
- Browse class hierarchies
- Read through source code

### Guides

A conceptual overview of the project.

<img src="https://imgur.com/dBBHo9M.png" alt="Example screenshot" width="500" />

Authored guides can be added as Markdown files in the _docs_ directory.
These files are automatically added to the project page's table of contents.

### Class hierarchy

A high-level view of the project's modules and their interactions.

<img src="https://imgur.com/PPttJFC.png" alt="Example screenshot" width="500" />

Classes, interfaces, functions, etc. are mapped and linked. If available, API docs are generated.
Any markdown files found in the same folder are added to the page.

### Literate source code

A low-level view of the individual source files.

<img src="https://imgur.com/8mshWSk.png" alt="Example screenshot" width="500" />

Docstrings and source comments are displayed alongside their relevant code sections.
Any markdown files found in the same folder are added to the page.
Markdown comments are supported.

_(Literate here refers to [Literate Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming))_

## Languages

Document generation is delegated to the appropriate library for the project language.
This can be overridden in the configuration.

### Language libraries

- Python: Pyccoon
- JavaScript: ESDocs
- C/C++: DOxygen
- Other: NaturalDocs

## Configuration

Create a `.angeldocs` file in the root directory.

[TODO]

## Tech/Framework used

- VuePress (static site generation)
- Pycco/Pyccoon (Python document generation)
- ESDocs (JavaScript document generation)
- DOxygen (C/C++ document generation)
- NaturalDocs (Any-language document generation)

## Github Action

To use the github action, add this snippet.

```yaml
# Run our action to document our code
- uses: KaiPrince/AngelDocs@latest
with:
    files: src
    folder: dist
    base-url: AngelDocs # REPLACE WITH BASE PATH FROM ROOT
    project-name: Angel-docs # REPLACE WITH YOUR PROJECT NAME
```

It is recommended to replace `latest` with the most recent version.

### Sample workflow

This is a basic workflow which generates the documentation site and deploys
to GitHub Pages.

```yaml
name: Generate Documentation

on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the main branch
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  document:
    name: Document and deploy
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Run our action to document our code
      - uses: KaiPrince/AngelDocs@v0.1
        with:
          files: src
          folder: dist
          base-url: AngelDocs # REPLACE WITH YOUR REPO NAME
          project-name: Angel-docs # REPLACE WITH YOUR PROJECT NAME

      # Publish to Pages
      - name: Deploy ðŸš€
        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@4.1.0
        with:
          branch: gh-pages # The branch the action should deploy to.
          folder: dist # The folder the action should deploy.
```
