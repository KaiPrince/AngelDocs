# AngelDocs
Generate beautiful and comprehensive documentation from source.

Supports multiple languages and multi-project repos.

## Motivation
Use this application to share knowledge and document intentions by code authors about specific pieces of code.
Accessible and comprehensive documentation benefits visitors to the code and speeds up the onboarding process.
By keeping the documentation as part of the source itself (internal documentation) as opposed to a seperate
library of documents and technical diagrams (external documentation), the documentation grows along with the
code. This keeps it relevant, useful, and available.

This project was inspired by the principles of _Living Documentation_.
